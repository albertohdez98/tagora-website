      These Terms of Use govern your use of the Routy application (“the App”).
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Acceptance of the Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By installing, accessing or using Routy, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use.
        If you do not agree, you should not use the App.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. About Routy</h2>
      <p>
        Routy is an experimental, indie project under Tagora.tech that helps users generate running or walking routes
        based on starting points, distance and other parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not guarantee that the routes generated will
        be accurate, safe, free of obstacles, or suitable for your particular situation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Use of the App and safety</h2>
      <p>You are solely responsible for how you use the routes generated by Routy. In particular, you agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will always pay attention to your surroundings, traffic, weather conditions and any local regulations.</li>
        <li>You will not rely exclusively on the App for navigation or safety decisions.</li>
        <li>You will adapt your route if you encounter unsafe conditions, private property or unexpected obstacles.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for your own physical condition and health before engaging in physical activity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that running or walking outdoors involves inherent risks. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
        we are not responsible for accidents, injuries, damages or losses arising from the use of the App or the routes it generates.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Accounts and data</h2>
      <p>
        If in the future the App allows you to create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
        your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your use of the App is also subject to our Privacy Policy, available at:
        <a href="/projects/routy/privacy-policy">/projects/routy/privacy-policy</a>.

        <li>Harass, stalk or harm other people.</li>
        <li>Attempt to interfere with the operation of the App or its infrastructure.</li>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Experimental nature and availability</h2>
      <p>
        Routy is an experimental, side project and may change or be discontinued at any time, with or without notice.
        We do not guarantee that the App will always be available, error-free or compatible with your device.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        The App may use third-party services (for example, map APIs or analytics). Those services are subject to their
        own terms and privacy policies, which you may wish to review.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including but not
        limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

      <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>

        consequential or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly,
        or for any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:
      </p>

        We may update Routy or these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the
        top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes are posted means you accept the revised Terms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of Ireland, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
